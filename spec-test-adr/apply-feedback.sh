PROMPT="ADR-0002 has been accepted and SPEC.md has already been updated to incorporate its changes (per the ADR process in ADR-0001). I am now updating TEST-SPEC.md to cover the new and changed spec behavior introduced by ADR-0002. I received the following feedback on the current state of TEST-SPEC.md. Apply this feedback by updating TEST-SPEC.md only — do not modify SPEC.md or ADR-0002, they are read-only references in this cycle. ADR-0002 and the updated SPEC.md are the authoritative sources for what TEST-SPEC.md should cover. If there is any ambiguity about my intentions, ask me clarifying questions. Think critically about this feedback and push back if warranted. After you finish, commit and push.
